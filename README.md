As the IT security specialist for Superior Sailmakers, youâ€™ve been assigned to investigate a USB drive that Ms. Olsen from Human Resources received anonymously. According to an accompanying letter, former employee Ralph Williams allegedly used confidential photos from ACE Sailboats to obtain a position at Smith Sloop Boats, a competitor of ACE. The letter specifies that the photos, purported to contain trade secrets, date back to April 2006, and that Williams left his role at Superior Sailmakers in January 2007.
